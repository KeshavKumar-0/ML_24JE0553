These ibynp and py files contain all the code written. 
I could not make it into a folder due to time constraints and me not being familiar with github. 
The csv files are the predictions with index and headers (default of to_csv). 
Some of the code has #type: ignore because it was initially written in Visual Studio Code and I had some issues in it causing it to yellow underline numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot despite them working completely fine.
